--- INTRODUCTION ---
--------------------

TorrentVolve is a cross-platform PHP-driven web-based BitTorrent client. 
It focuses on speed and reliability, while also providing a full 
feature set. It includes a user management system, a Torrent file 
manager, and a configurable Torrent downloader.

The purpose of this installation guide is to provide you with 
easy-to-follow instructions for installing TorrentVolve on top of 
Ubuntu.

The following packages (and their dependencies) will be installed:
	- apache2
	- php5
	- java-gcj-compat OR sun-java5-jre (which is recommended)
	- unzip

We recommend at least the following system specifications for 
a TorrentVolve server running on Ubuntu:
	- 500 MHz processor
	- 128 MB RAM
	- 20 MB free hard drive space for TorrentVolve installation

Note: This guide was written for Ubuntu 6.10, but it should work for 
other versions of Ubuntu.

-------------------------
--- INSTALLING UBUNTU ---
-------------------------

The first thing you want to do is download a copy of Ubuntu from 
http://www.ubuntu.com/download. You can install TorrentVolve on any 
flavor of Ubuntu: Desktop, Server or Alternate.

If you need help installing Ubuntu, refer to this helpful installation 
guide: http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.06.

-------------------------
--- INSTALLING APACHE ---
-------------------------

Once Ubuntu is installed, login using the account you created during the 
installation process.

Install the Apache HTTP Server by running (you'll need to enter the root 
password):
	sudo apt-get install apache2

You should be able to access your Apache server at http://localhost.

----------------------
--- INSTALLING PHP ---
----------------------

Now that Apache is installed, you can install PHP. But first, you need 
to enable other package repositories in your APT's /etc/apt/sources.list 
file by adding or simply uncommenting the following lines (some of these 
lines may already be uncommented):
	deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe
	deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy multiverse
In the United States:
	deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe
	deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy multiverse

After doing this, update the APT cache:
	sudo apt-get update

Go ahead and install PHP on top of Apache by running the following:
	sudo apt-get install php5

-----------------------
--- INSTALLING JAVA ---
-----------------------

The final package you need to install is the Java runtime. You can 
install one of two packages: java-gcj-compat or sun-java5-jre. We 
recommend using sun-java5-jre, as the Azureus CLI (which is what 
TorrentVolve uses to manage Torrents by default) works much better with 
it.

Run the following to install the java-gcj-compat package: 
	sudo apt-get install java-gcj-compat

OR

You can install sun-java5-jre by following a few steps. First you should 
remove the java-gcj-compat package since Ubuntu uses it as its default 
Java runtime:
	sudo apt-get remove --purge java-gcj-compat

You can now install the sun-java5-jre pacakge:
	sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre

Once you have installed either java-gcj-compat or sun-java5-jre, run the 
"java" command. This command should successfully execute and return its 
syntax help.

------------------------
--- INSTALLING UNZIP ---
------------------------

Depending on how you installed Ubuntu, you may or may not have the unzip 
package. Run the following to make sure you have unzip installed:
	sudo apt-get install unzip

-------------------------------
--- INSTALLING TORRENTVOLVE ---
-------------------------------

Download the latest version of TorrentVolve from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=179905. The 
installation file will be a .zip file.

If you are using a command-line-only install of Ubuntu, use wget to get 
the TorrentVolve install file:
	wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/torrentvolve/torrentvolve-<version>.zip?download
In our case:
	wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/torrentvolve/torrentvolve-1.3-beta.zip?download

If you plan to use the /var/www folder for your TorrentVolve 
installation, clear out its default contents first:
	sudo rm -r /var/www/*

Unzip TorrentVolve to your chosen installation directory:
	sudo unzip -d <installation directory> torrentvolve-<version>.zip
In our case:
	sudo unzip -d /var/www torrentvolve-1.3-beta.zip

Change to your TorrentVolve installation directory:
	cd <installation directory>
In our case:
	cd /var/www

You need to enable write access to certain TorrentVolve directories:
	sudo chmod a+w config
	sudo chmod a+w site/lib/torrentmodules/tvAzureusBridge/azureusServer

Then, create a download directory for TorrentVolve (this will be where 
the Torrent Module saves downloaded Torrents):
	sudo mkdir <download directory>
In our case:
	sudo mkdir downloads

Like for the other two directories, enable write access to the download 
directory:
	sudo chmod a+w <download directory>
In our case:
	sudo chmod a+w downloads

The last step to installing TorrentVolve is pointing your Apache site to 
the TorrentVolve site directory. Open the 
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default file in a text editor:
	example: sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
	example: sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
Find the line:
	DocumentRoot /var/www
And change it to read:
	DocumentRoot <installation directory>
In our case:
	DocumentRoot /var/www/site
Then, find the line:
	<Directory /var/www/>
And change it to read:
	<Directory <installation directory>>
In our case:
	<Directory /var/www/site>

After you have changed the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file, 
reload the Apache server configuration:
	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload

You should now be able to access TorrentVolve via http://locahost. 
Fill out the form to configure TorrentVolve.
