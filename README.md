## Improvements ##

I'm using the version «1.4 Beta» which is the latest that was released
as a starting point to my developments.

I basically want to add a few features that I think this project is missing
and maybe try to improve its look and feel, if I find the time.

Here are the features I've added so far :

* Added an admin option to prevent "basic" users from seeing other users torrents.
